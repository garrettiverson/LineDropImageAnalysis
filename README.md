# LineDropImageAnalysis
Analysis of output images from the line drop simulation in CamSim. This is a simulation of an LED at different depths through the ice and how the photons are received by a camera on the DOM. Plan is to develop a likelihood function based on LED orientation and brightness to determine the ice layer tilt. I will be using the ICU_Image_analysis framework.
